These succinct sentences sum up the issue for missing data as detailed in the reviewed book Missing Data: A Gentle Introduction, which presents the many approaches developed to address missing data. Gentle, as in a simplified version, the book Missing Data offers solutions and guides for the problem of missing data as it relates to research design and statistical analyses, suited for a novice's understanding of the complexities inherent in this topic. Although the chosen writing style is a rather redundant one of \u201ctell them again what was just told,\u201d the book does succeed in providing a comprehensive and nuanced discussion of the complexities and variety of solutions. It also offers approaches to reduce the likelihood of obtaining missing data by considering research procedures or design.\nThis book serves as one of the better introductions to this topic for students and will be useful for others seeking a more general overview of approaches for missing data. Having taken a summer graduate-level course with Roderick Little and attended a number of local chapter American Statistical Association presentations related to this topic, I appreciated reviewing the book for its overview and synthesis of known statistical solutions, along with the practical techniques suggested to prevent the occurrence of missing data.

The purpose of this study was to test assumptions made in the development and implementation of the ASSET project. The three assumptions were that living conditions of the homeless adult drug user in\ufb02uence willingness for treatment; willingness relates to treat\u2014ment tenure; and, conditions, willingness and time in treatment in\ufb02u\u2014ence treatment outcomes. Data on alcohol use, drug use, employ-ment and housing as well as motivation, readiness and suitability of treatment were collected from 494 homeless adults at baseline and at follow\u2014up. Data were subjected to multivariate causal analysis using factor analytic structural equations modeling. Practical fit indices were acceptable. The measurement model confirmed a higher order",

Research suggests rather than designating someone as curious or not, there is benefit in detailing scores on multiple dimensions. In this multi-national study, we examined how four workplace curiosity dimensions (Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, and Openness to People\u2019s Ideas) operate with employees (adults aged 19 to over 55) working in 23 countries. Our results include nine countries with sufficient sample sizes (N> 250) to estimate stable correlations (Perugini, Gallucci, & Costantini, 2014): Germany (2,742), USA (1,860), China (1,131), France (705), India (451), Italy (413), Taiwan (320), Brazil (298), and Mexico (264). In seeking the most efficient manifest variables that minimize respondent burden, we found support for removing a single item per subscale. We also found evidence that the four-factor structure of curiosity showed generalizability across different geographical locations, age ranges, and biological sex. We detail the comparative psychometrics of both the original and new, briefer versions of the M-Workplace Curiosity Scale. Our approach offers a template for cross-cultural measurement approaches. Scientists cannot assume generalizability; it must be tested to understand whether, how, and when psychological strengths such as curiosity operate.",

The PSQ assesses couples' appreciation of, and recognition of costs associated with, partners' personality strengths. Respondents first list 3 partner strengths after reflecting on strengths listed in the Values in Action taxonomy (Peterson & Seligman, 2004). Following this, they answer a set of 9 questions on a 7-point Likert-type scale for each of the listed strengths. Factor analyses supported the reliability of a 2-factor structure and results showed that greater appreciation of partner strengths predicted greater relationship satisfaction, commitment, investment, intimacy, self-expansion, and support for goal pursuit; recognizing significant costs with partner strengths was inversely related to several outcomes.

These succinct sentences sum up the issue for missing data as detailed in the reviewed book Missing Data: A Gentle Introduction, which presents the many approaches developed to address missing data. Gentle, as in a simplified version, the book Missing Data offers solutions and guides for the problem of missing data as it relates to research design and statistical analyses, suited for a novice's understanding of the complexities inherent in this topic. Although the chosen writing style is a rather redundant one of \u201ctell them again what was just told,\u201d the book does succeed in providing a comprehensive and nuanced discussion of the complexities and variety of solutions. It also offers approaches to reduce the likelihood of obtaining missing data by considering research procedures or design.\nThis book serves as one of the better introductions to this topic for students and will be useful for others seeking a more general overview of approaches for missing data. Having taken a summer graduate-level course with Roderick Little and attended a number of local chapter American Statistical Association presentations related to this topic, I appreciated reviewing the book for its overview and synthesis of known statistical solutions, along with the practical techniques suggested to prevent the occurrence of missing data.

Research suggests rather than designating someone as curious or not, there is benefit in detailing scores on multiple dimensions. In this multi-national study, we examined how four workplace curiosity dimensions (Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, and Openness to People\u2019s Ideas) operate with employees (adults aged 19 to over 55) working in 23 countries. Our results include nine countries with sufficient sample sizes (N> 250) to estimate stable correlations (Perugini, Gallucci, & Costantini, 2014): Germany (2,742), USA (1,860), China (1,131), France (705), India (451), Italy (413), Taiwan (320), Brazil (298), and Mexico (264). In seeking the most efficient manifest variables that minimize respondent burden, we found support for removing a single item per subscale. We also found evidence that the four-factor structure of curiosity showed generalizability across different geographical locations, age ranges, and biological sex. We detail the comparative psychometrics of both the original and new, briefer versions of the M-Workplace Curiosity Scale. Our approach offers a template for cross-cultural measurement approaches. Scientists cannot assume generalizability; it must be tested to understand whether, how, and when psychological strengths such as curiosity operate.",

Respondents first list 3 partner strengths after reflecting on strengths listed in the Values in Action taxonomy (Peterson & Seligman, 2004). Following this, they answer a set of 9 questions on a 7-point Likert-type scale for each of the listed strengths. Factor analyses supported the reliability of a 2-factor structure and results showed that greater appreciation of partner strengths predicted greater relationship satisfaction, commitment, investment, intimacy, self-expansion, and support for goal pursuit; recognizing significant costs with partner strengths was inversely related to several outcomes. Results supported the internal consistency \u2026",
